"""Forward-lock model over/under (totals) probabilities for UNPLAYED group
matches, so the report card can grade CALIBRATED totals this tournament —
the pre-tournament bracket was locked without them. Write-once per match,
and only while the match is still in the future, so every entry is a
genuine pre-kickoff prediction graded going forward as results land.

  python3 pipeline/wc26_totals_lock.py     # lock any newly-lockable fixtures

Output (committed): data/wc26_totals_locked.json
  {locked_from, line, matches: {mid: {locked_at, kickoff, line,
   over_model, over_market, over_blend}}}
Disclosed on the report card as totals locked from a mid-tournament date,
kept separate from the pristine pre-tournament bracket on purpose.
